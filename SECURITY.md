# Security Policy

This project is an open source Chrome extension and we take its security seriously. If you believe you have found a vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email details to [security@check.com](mailto:security@check.com). Please include steps to reproduce, extension version, browser version, and any relevant logs. You may request our PGP key for encrypted communication. Avoid publicly disclosing the issue until we confirm a fix.

## Disclosure Guidelines

- Give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and resolve the issue before any public disclosure (typically 90 days).
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to confirm their existence.
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting user data without explicit permission.
- Limit testing to accounts and systems you own or have permission to test. When possible, test against a local instance of the extension loaded in developer mode rather than the Chrome Web Store version.

## Response Timelines

- **Acknowledgement:** within 48 hours.
- **Initial assessment:** within 5 business days.
- **Resolution target:** within 30 days, or we will provide an updated timeline.
