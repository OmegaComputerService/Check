# Check

An open-source, Manifest V3 browser extension for detecting phishing attacks that
impersonate Microsoft 365 sign-in pages.

Install it from the [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/benimdeioplgkhanklclahllklceahbe) Store here or the [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/check-by-cyberdrain/knepjpocdagponkonnbggpcnhnaikajg) store here.

## Features 

- **Detection engine** – loads rules from `rules/detection-rules.json` and
  analyses URLs and page content to block or warn about suspicious sites
  targeting Microsoft 365 credentials
- **Configuration management** – merges local settings, branding, and browser
  policies provided through Chrome managed storage (GPO/Intune)
- **Policy enforcement & logging** – loads enterprise policies, tracks
  compliance mode, and records audit events for security reporting
- **Custom branding** – logos, colors, and messaging are defined in
  `config/branding.json` and can be replaced for white‑label deployments
- **Options & popup interfaces** – interactive pages (`options/`, `popup/`) let
  administrators adjust settings and view detection status

## Requirements

- Chrome 88+ or other Chromium-based browsers supporting Manifest V3
- Optional enterprise management via Group Policy or Microsoft Intune for
  policy enforcement
